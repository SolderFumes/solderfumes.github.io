That being said, I totally ran up my fossil fuel powered electricity bill in 2021 (Eighth grade for me! Wow!) running a 6-GPU Ethereum mining rig. Being above the age of thirteen now, I would likely not recreate this project, but I did learn a lot! Heres a little bit about the rig:<br><br>The rig is powered by a 1200W server power supply, an old refurbished ASUS Prime Z390-P motherboard with six PCIe slots, an Intel i3-9100F, and some cheap 8gig RAM stick from aliexpress. Doing the actual mining is three RTX 3060tis, two RTX 3060s, and an RTX 3070 Super, which were all purchased for EXORBITANT $800 or higher price tags (each GPU lost about $500 in resale value after 1 year). The rig ran HiveOS (hiveon.com), which is a custom closed-source Linux distribution that allowed very easy web-based remote access and performance monitoring.<br><br><video width='270px' height='480px' controls><source src='/images/video.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video><p class='caption'>An early version of the mining rig featuring 13 year old Luka</p><br><br>Let‚Äôs talk about a hardware-related oddity that came with this rig: The motherboard has two PCIe X16 slots, which are the full size ones that you likely have in your desktop, and four PCIe X1 slots, which are about a quarter of the size and cannot fit a standard GPU without our first odd item: PCIe risers! As you can see in the video, the GPUs are not actually sitting on the motherboard, but on a bar. This is achieved through PCIe risers that act as adapters between the X16 and X1 slots and are powered via USB 3.0 or a 4-pin power connector from the server PSU.<br><br>One of the biggest concerns with any big computer is cooling. One of the biggest concerns for a sweaty person living in North Texas during the summer is also cooling. Unlike a real data center, I do not have multiple air conditioning units meticulously cooling all of my components. However! I did have my family‚Äôs shared office with one <a href='https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-18V-Cordless-Hybrid-WHISPER-SERIES-7-1-2-in-Fan-Tool-Only-PCL811B/318754250' target='_blank'>Ryobi cordless fan</a> and a <b>huge</b> and <b>very loud</b> fan fitted to the window to allow for better ventilation. This did help enough to prevent thermal bottlenecking, but I definitely recommend against putting your torturously hot 1200W mining rig right next to your everyday workstation in one of the hottest states in the US.<br><br>In the end, I gained a ton of valuable knowledge from this project and am super grateful to have gotten this opportunity in middle school! <br><br>P.S: Don‚Äôt trust a middle schooler when they give you a business idea, this project lost at least four figures.";
