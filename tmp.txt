<h2>C++ Card Game</h2>In December of 2024, I made a card game in C++ for my Computer Science Foundations II course at Cal Poly Humboldt. If you want to know how to play the game, there are instructions in the github repo! The game uses the SDL2 library to handle all of the graphics. All of the programming was done over a period of about one week.<br><br>The visuals could use a bit of an overhaul although I think there’s a bit of a charm to the pixel art that I drew using a trackpad at an ungodly hour of the night/morning 😁.
